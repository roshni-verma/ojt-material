Q.1 what is supervised learning,and how does it differ from unsupervised learning?
mathematical component write the general form of a supervised learning model.explain the role of the loss functionL(y,y^) in traing the model.

SUPERVISED LEARNING- supervised learning is a labeled data.
UNSUPERVISED LEARNING - Unsupervised learning is unlabeled data.
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained using labeled data. 
 "labeled" means that each training example is paired with an output label.
Examples include classification and regression tasks.

Unsupervised Learning:Uses unlabeled data.
The goal is to identify patterns or structure in the data.
Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

The loss function L(y, y^ ) quantifies how well the model's predictions y^ match the true labels y.


Q5. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:- unsupervised learning is a labeled data.
the goal is to identify patterns or structure in the data.
ex-include clustering and dimensionlity reduction. 

Two real world application:-1.natural language processing.
2.image and video analysis.

Q4. svm (support vector machine) is used to classify data by finding the optimal decision boundary that maximally separated diffrent classes. 
 The kernel trick is a method used in SVM to enable them to classify non-linear data using a linear classifier.
