one hot day a crow was very thirsty.
he searched for water everywhere. but there was no water anywhere.all the lakes and ponds were dirty.at last he saw a pot under a tree with very little 
water in it.
he tried hard but could not reach the water as it was very low.he picked up pebbles one by one and dropped them into the pot.the level of water came up.the crow drank the water and felling very happy.
