What is Machine Learning?


Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Machine learning is a subset of AI.

Features of Machine learning:-

1.It is similar to data mining because it is also deals with the huge amount of data.
2.Machine can learn itself from past data and automatically improve.
3.From the given dataset it detects various patterns on data.
4.Machine learning is data driven technology. 


Why we use machine learning ?
Answer:Machine learning is used to make decisions based on data. By modelling the algorithms on the bases of historical data, Algorithms find the patterns and relationships that are difficult for humans to detect. These patterns are now further use for the future references to predict solution of unseen problems.

What is the difference between classification and regression methods?
Classification: Assigns labels to data classes.

Machine Learning for classification
Classification is a process of categorizing data or objects into predefined classes or categories based on their features or attributes.

4 Types of Machine Learning 

Supervised Learning:- Supervised learning is defined as when a model gets trained on a “Labelled Dataset”. Labelled datasets have both input and output parameters. In Supervised Learning algorithms learn to map points between inputs and correct outputs. It has both training and validation datasets labelled.Supervised learning involves training a machine and its algorithm using labeled training data, and requires a significant amount of human guidance.
Unsupervised Learning:- Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning technique in which an algorithm discovers patterns and relationships using unlabeled data.
Semi-Supervised Learning:-
Reinforcement Learning:-


Supervised Learning:-There are two main categories of supervised learning that are mentioned below:

Classification
Regression
Classification:-Classification deals with predicting categorical target variables, which represent discrete classes or labels. For instance, classifying emails as spam or not spam, or predicting whether a patient has a high risk of heart disease. Classification algorithms learn to map the input features to one of the predefined classes.

Here are some classification algorithms:-Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine
Random Forest
Decision Tree
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes

Regression:-
Regression, on the other hand, deals with predicting continuous target variables, which represent numerical values. For example, predicting the price of a house based on its size, location, and amenities, or forecasting the sales of a product. Regression algorithms learn to map the input features to a continuous numerical value.

Here are some regression algorithms:-Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression

Semi-Supervised learning is a machine learning algorithm that works between the supervised and unsupervised learning so it uses both labelled and unlabelled data.

Types of Semi-Supervised Learning Methods
There are a number of different semi-supervised learning methods each with its own characteristics. Some of the most common ones include:

Graph-based semi-supervised learning: This approach uses a graph to represent the relationships between the data points. The graph is then used to propagate labels from the labeled data points to the unlabeled data points.
Label propagation: This approach iteratively propagates labels from the labeled data points to the unlabeled data points, based on the similarities between the data points.
Co-training: This approach trains two different machine learning models on different subsets of the unlabeled data. The two models are then used to label each other’s predictions.
Self-training: This approach trains a machine learning model on the labeled data and then uses the model to predict labels for the unlabeled data. The model is then retrained on the labeled data and the predicted labels for the unlabeled data.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs): GANs are a type of deep learning algorithm that can be used to generate synthetic data. GANs can be used to generate unlabeled data for semi-supervised learning by training two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator.
